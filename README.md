## Overview

This is my solution to a responsive Social Media Dashboard web application, that displays an overview of each platforms metrics, alongside intergrating a custom modal window upon clicking the main component - which gives a deeper insight into each platforms analytics via data visualisation charts customised for each dataset.

The application should scale appropriately so several screen sizes and serves a good foundation for a social dashboard that can display all relevant metrics for each channel.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Toggle color theme to their preference
- Open a Modal Window and See Unique Analytics for each Platform.

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/animation/) - Animation
- [Recharts](https://recharts.org/en-UK/api) - Data Visualisation
- [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) - Icons

### What I learned

I learned how to intergrate grid layouts and optimise them for a mobile friendly responsive design, alongside utilising modal windows to display complex data in the form of custom charts (through the Recharts Library). Overall, the grid layouts made responsiveness much easier than previous projects, and i took away alot of positive techniques from the use of them.

### Continued development

In future, I would love to intergrate some back-end functionality including features like authentication, profile switching, and live-feed connections to social media URL's using their respective API's to extract and implement the data for channels - potentially being able to search up and display live feeds of any channel.

### Useful resources

- [Recharts API](https://recharts.org/en-US/api) - This helped me understand Data Visualisation and customisation for displaying information on various charts.

I would like to Acknowledge [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship) for showing me how to intergrate a custom modal window using Framer-motion to perform complex, yet subtle animations for on-screen and off-screen movements.
